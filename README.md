# flutter_bluetooth_communication
Simple example of a Flutter app which sends and receives data over Bluetooth.

The purpose of this project is to experiment with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication in Flutter, which may serve as a foundation for future mobile applications that will interface with some embedded hardware projects I am working on.
